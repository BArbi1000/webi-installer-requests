# Add CHANGE-ME

<!-- what do you want to see added to webinstall.dev? why? -->

We want to add `CHANGE-ME` because...

- it works consistently across Windows, Mac, and Linux.

# How to create a webi installer

See the **short instructions** and **demo video** in the
[README.md](https://github.com/webinstall/webi-installer-requests)
at <https://github.com/webinstall/webi-installer-requests>.

# Note to contributors

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/webinstall.dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)

It's also okay to have multiple people work on part of this (i.e. the Cheat
Sheet can be done independently from the `install.sh`)
